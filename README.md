# Fretboard Trainer

The purpose of this app is to close the gap between your mental model of a piano keyboard and a guitar fretboard. The app will randomly select a guitar note and the aim is to play the note back on the keyboard (in the correct octave). When the right note is played, another random fret will be generated.
